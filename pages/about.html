My name is Leonard. I'm a 26 year old male of Vietnamese descent. 
I am a <strong>casual hobbyist weightlifter</strong>, I used to be a provincial level olympic weightlifter; however, I decided to be a <em>lazy casual</em> instead.
Mainly because the work volume per week of weightlifting is tiring and draining on the joints, ligaments, muscles, nervous system, etc.
